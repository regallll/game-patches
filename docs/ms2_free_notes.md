## This patch will remain 'EXPERIMENTAL' for now as it has so many issues. It does allow you to freeroam, however it crashes/freezes with AI, it breaks checkpoints, it crashes/freezes with many tracks, and because it spawns you at (0, 0, 0), it can put you in weird places, for example under or outside the map. Please see below for more information.
