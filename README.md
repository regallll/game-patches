# game-patches
A repository containing all my game patches (that aren't on official patch managers) for currently, only RPCS3. But various other platforms may come too.

To install the RPCS3 patches, follow the guidance on the official RPCS3 Wiki [here](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Help:Game_Patches#:~:text=boot%20the%20game.-,Manually%20adding%20custom%20patches,-edit).
